MICROSOFT FILM STUDIO PROJECT

Overview:
This project intends to use data science approaches to examine current trends in the film business and make recommendations to Microsoft who would like to open a movie studio. Using data on box office performance, audience ratings, genre preferences, and other pertinent indicators, we want to uncover what genre to go for.

Business Understanding:
Microsoft acknowledges the growing trend of large corporations delving into original video content development and intends to establish its footprint in the entertainment business by establishing a new movie studio. However, due to a lack of prior expertise in film production, Microsoft wants to learn about the types of films that are currently doing well at the box office. The goal is to assist strategic decision-making at the new film studio, allowing Microsoft to create content that resonates with audiences and drives financial success.

Key Business Questions:
1. Which genres of films are currently dominating the box office?
2. How do factors such as budget influence a film's box office performance?
3. Which are the top performing studios?

Key stakeholders:
1. Microsoft Executives and Decision-Makers: Senior executives and decision-makers within Microsoft would be the primary stakeholders driving the strategic direction of the new movie studio. 
2.Content Creators and Filmmakers: Content creators, filmmakers, directors, writers, and other creative professionals involved in the production of Microsoft's films 
3. Movie Studio Leadership Team: The leadership team of Microsoft's new movie studio, including studio heads, producers, and creative directors, would be closely involved in interpreting and implementing the findings from the box office data analysis.
4. Marketing and Distribution Teams: Marketing and distribution teams within Microsoft's movie studio would be stakeholders interested in understanding audience preferences and market trends to develop effective marketing campaigns and distribution strategies for the studio's films. 


Objectives:
1. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of the film industry, genre preferences.
2. Translate insights into actionable recommendations that can guide Microsoft's new movie studio in deciding what types of films to create.

Data Understanding:
The data used in this project are data collected from:

https://www.boxofficemojo.com/
https://www.imdb.com/
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/
https://www.themoviedb.org/

6	persons
7	principals
8	writers

Data Preparation:
Once the data is understood, it needs to be prepared for analysis. This phase involved cleaning, transforming, and merging some of the data to make it suitable for analysing. Tasks may included handling missing values, outlier detection, duplicates, wrong data types.

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following:
1. Based on the genre, Microsoft should focus on Drama, comedy and action as they are the top three highly areted genres.
2. Focus on the R-rated movies as they are most popular among the audience.
3. Microsoft should ensure that they allocate high production budgets to the produce movies based on the positive correlation between the production budget and the net profits of about 0.6.
4. The company shouls also consider patnering with other studios like Universal pictures studio tops, 20th century Fox and Paramount pictures who top the list of popular studios.
