MICROSOFT FILM STUDIO PROJECT

Overview:
This project intends to use data science approaches to examine current trends in the film business and make recommendations to a Microsoft interested in researching successful films that are currently performing well at the box office. Using data on box office performance, audience ratings, genre preferences, and other pertinent indicators, we want to uncover what genre to go for.

Business Understanding:
Microsoft acknowledges the growing trend of large corporations delving into original video content development and intends to establish its footprint in the entertainment business by establishing a new movie studio. However, due to a lack of prior expertise in film production, Microsoft wants to learn about the types of films that are currently doing well at the box office. The goal is to assist strategic decision-making at the new film studio, allowing Microsoft to create content that resonates with audiences and drives financial success.

Key Business Questions:
1. Which genres of films are currently dominating the box office?
2. How do factors such as budget influence a film's box office performance?

Objectives:
1. Gain a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of the film industry, genre preferences.
2. Translate insights into actionable recommendations that can guide Microsoft's new movie studio in deciding what types of films to create.
